# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello, World! I discovered my passion for computers when I was ten years old.
Since then, I've not only mastered various programming languages, but I've also
earned six industry-based certificates from Microsoft. During my free time, I've
been reading books about Linux, learning Computer Science through OSSU, and
taking The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp's full-stack development courses.
