# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello, World! I discovered my passion for computers when I was ten years old.
Since then, I've not only mastered various programming languages, but I've also
earned six industry-based certificates from Microsoft. During my free time, I've
been learning Linux Administration and studying Computer Science through OSSU,
with plans to become a software engineer.
