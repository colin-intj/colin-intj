# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

My name is Colin and I discovered my passion for computers when I was ten years
old. Since then, I've not only mastered various programming languages, but I've
also earned six industry-based certificates from Microsoft. I'm currently taking
The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp courses with plans to become a full-stack
developer.
